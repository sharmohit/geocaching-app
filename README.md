# üìçGeocaching App

## Requirements and Implementation
The Toronto Geocaching Club has hired you to develop an application that enables users to use
their phone to participate in geocaching in the Toronto area.
<br><br>
Geocaching is an outdoor activity where players hide random objects in random locations
around a specific geographical area. The goal of the activity is to 1) hide objects for others to
find, and 2) locate objects hidden by others.
<br><br>
If the player hides an object for others to find, the player must report the latitude and longitude
of where they hid the object. Examples of where an object could be hidden include: under a
rock in the forest, inside a tree stump, under a park bench, in a hole of a building‚Äôs brick wall,
etc. Note that the player does not specify exactly where they placed the object. The player
simply reports the latitude and longitude of the object‚Äôs location.
<br><br>
After the coordinates of the location is reported, other players can search for the object.
Searchers travel to the lat lng coordinate, and then manually search the area for the hidden
object. Because (lat,lng) coordinates generally cover a large region, it is never immediately
obvious is hidden. For example, a single (lat, lng) coordinate could cover a small city park.
Players would travel to the park, and then search for where the object is hidden within the park.
They would manually look at the trees in the park, the playground, etc. etc.

<br><br>
Using React Native, build a cross platform mobile application that enables users to search for
geocaching sites and keep a record of the items they find.
<br><br>
Your app must provide the following features:
- Display a list of geocaching sites that are **near the current location of the user‚Äôs
device**
- Display the nearby geocaching sites on a map (with pins)
- Show details about a specific geocaching site (the name of the cache, description of the
item the person is searching for, latitude and longitude)
- Ability to mark a specific geocaching site as a ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù
- Record keeping features:
  - User can track which geocache sites they have ‚Äúin progress‚Äù or ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù
  - User can keep notes about a specific geocache site (example: I found it by the
water fountain; I searched all the trees but didn‚Äôt see anything, etc)
  - User can take a photo of the geocache site (or the item they found)
